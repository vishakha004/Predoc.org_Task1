# Predoc.org_Task1
This repository contains my attempt to solve the coding assignment from the PREDOC.org, available publicly at https://uchicago.app.box.com/s/0lrni05mpgsvtgnzafp81kmnghoff8ya.

## Folder Description and Sources

### Raw data:
This sample data task will use resource-level scheduled output data from the Electricity Relia-
bility Council of Texas (ERCOT)

## Code
All code here is written and run in Stata BE (Basic Edition). It is recommended to use the Do-file Editor in Stata for executing the scripts.

## How to Run

**Step 1:**
Download the Instructions PDF and the raw_data folder. Make sure to store all data sets as named in the repository.

**Step 2:**
Set the folder the data is stored in as Working Directory. Note that all Stata scripts must be created in the same Working Directory.

**Step 3:**
Download the do_file.do, and open it in Stata. Set the Working Directory as on your machine, and run the script to get cleaned and merged data set, as well as the solutions to the given problems. The Solutions PDF compiles all these answers.
